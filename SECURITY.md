## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.


To report a vulnerability you should send an email to secure@d-skinner.com. You will get an update once the issue has been accepted and resolved.
